# JavaScript 2 - Module 2

## Lesson Task 2.3

Use an input box and button to add new objects to an array called `todos`.

Create an HTML list by looping over the array.

Each object should have three properties: `id`, `name` and `isComplete`.

The `name` property should be displayed in a textbox and be updateable on the `keyup` event.

Each item should include a checkbox that toggles the `isComplete` property between `true` and `false`.

If the `isComplete` property is true the whole item should be displayed at 50% opacity.

The array should be saved in and retrieved from localStorage.
